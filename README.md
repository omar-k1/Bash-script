## Project Description:-
Develop a Bash script that monitors various aspects of a Linux system and provides real-time insights into system performance. This project will allow you to practice Bash scripting fundamentals while creating a tool that can be used to monitor CPU usage, memory usage and disk space. The script will display the collected data in a user-friendly format and provide alerts for potential issues & develop a tool that helps users manage files and directories efficiently. The script will provide functionalities such as creating, copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories, as well as searching for files based on specified criteria.


Create a Bash script that serves as a file management tool for Linux systems. This project will allow you to practice Bash scripting concepts while developing a tool that helps users manage files and directories efficiently. The script will provide functionalities such as creating, copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories, as well as searching for files based on specified criteria.


##Project Features:-

### 1-File and Directory Operations:

Implement functionalities to **create**, **copy**, **move**, **rename**, and **delete** files & directories.
***Prompt*** users to provide input for file/directory names and target locations.

### 2- searching:-

Develop a file search function that allows users to search for files based on specified criteria.
Criteria can include **file name**, **file type**, **file size**, and **modification date**.

### 3-Permissions Management:-

Allow users to change file permissions (***chmod***) and ownership (***chown***) using the script.
Provide options to specify permission modes and user/group ownership.


### Backup and Restore:-

Implement backup and restore functionalities to create backups of files/directories and restore them when needed.
Utilize tar command for creating and extracting backups.


### System Information Display:-

Use commands to gather basic system information.
Display the system's operating system, hostname, uptime, and current date/time.

### CPU Usage Monitoring:-

Utilize commands to retrieve CPU usage statistics.
Display the current CPU usage percentage.

### Memory Usage Monitoring:-

Use commands to retrieve memory usage statistics.
Display the total available memory, used memory, and free memory.

### Disk Space Monitoring:-

Utilize commands to retrieve disk space usage statistics.
Display the total disk space, used space, and available space for each mounted filesystem.


### Logging and Reporting:-

Generate a summary report of system metrics and save it to a specified location.


-------------------------------------------


###File Management:-

    - Create, copy, move, rename, and delete files and directories.
    - Search for files based on name, type, size, and modification date.
    - Change file permissions and ownership.
    - Backup and restore files and directories.

###System Monitoring:-

    - Display system information (OS, hostname, uptime, date/time).
    - Monitor CPU usage.
    - Monitor memory usage.
    - Monitor disk space usage.
    - Generate system metrics reports.


---------------------------------------------

## additional tasks

###Interactive Menu:-

Create an interactive menu that presents users with options for System Monitoring options or different file management operations.
Use select statement to display menu options and handle user input.
Provide an interactive menu for users to choose which system metrics to monitor.

###Error Handling:-

Implement error handling mechanisms to validate user input and handle exceptions gracefully.
Provide informative error messages when operations fail due to incorrect input or other issues.

###Confirmation Prompts:-

Include confirmation prompts for critical operations such as file deletion and renaming.
Ensure that users confirm their actions before proceeding to avoid accidental data loss.
